# Nostalgia Anti-Cheat

This an abandoned Anti-cheat client created especially for a Brazilian community of _Scavenge and Survive_, called _Nostalgia_.

It's aim was to be as simple and easy as possible to cater for the type of players this community had at the time.

Eventually it was met with extreme resistance from the entire community. So development was terminated and so was the gameserver.

## What is Scavenge and Survive?

_Scavenge and Survive_ is a revolutionary gamemode for _SA-MP_ (sa-mp is **dead** - it's legacy is now [open.mp](https://open.mp)) with the aim to be a Survival PvP type gamemode, created by [_Southclaws_](https://github.com/Southclaws).
It's source-code is open-source and can viewed here: [GitHub](https://github.com/ScavengeSurvive)

IIRC, it's first iteration was put on a live server in 2013.

## Why the name "Nostalgia"?

Because if was supposed to be a "nostalgic" comeback of this gamemode since people stopped hosting it years before. See the reasons below.

## Why was the gameserver terminated?

_SA-MP_ was always plagued with hacking since it's inception. Being that this was a base building survival gamemode, players had to spend inumerous hours finding build items, on top of the rarest items - explosives (in order to raid player's bases).

Preventing players that were airbreaking into bases, using different textures for prefered items and whatnot was always near impossible.

Player's bases would get illegally breached and cause constant rage quit. Leading to rapid loss in playerbase.
